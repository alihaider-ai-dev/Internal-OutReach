|Data sharing                                  |Interoperability challenges hamper data-driven insights.             |AI-driven APIs and data transformations standardize formats across multiple EHR systems, payers, and devices. Generative AI can map disparate data schemas, easing data exchange and improving interoperability without extensive manual coding.|High (greater interoperability, better insights)      |Medium (standards evolving)              |Medium term        |EHR and claims data, healthcare interoperability standards (HL7/FHIR), integration tools|
|HR functions                                  |HR tasks (recruitment, onboarding) are repetitive and time-consuming.|AI automates applicant screening, matches candidates to roles, and generates onboarding documents. Generative AI can also draft performance reviews and training materials, improving HR efficiency and consistency.|Medium (faster HR processes, reduced manual workload) |High (mature HR automation)              |Short term         |HR data, job descriptions, NLP-based matching tools                                     |
|Personalized and automated corporate functions|Corporate functions are often generic and time-consuming.            |Generative AI can produce auto-generated knowledge management content, meeting summaries, and tailored office application templates. It can serve as an intelligent assistant, responding to employee queries and automating routine tasks, saving time across departments.|Medium (time savings, improved internal communication)|High (office automation tools are robust)|Short to Medium    |Internal data (docs, wikis), office suite APIs, secure environment                      |
